# Abstract

Here, I re-examine the analysis of Oeppen and Vaupel (2002).

# Analysis
```{r}
gapminder::gapminder_unfiltered %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(year, country, lifeExp) %>% 
  arrange(year) ->
  sumdat
```
I added some text

this is even more text

Revised again.

This does not seem to be working.
